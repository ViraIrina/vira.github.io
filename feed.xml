			<![CDATA[ <p>Le notizie che arrivano dalla Francia confermano il trend che si era ormai delineato da tempo. In caso di elezioni, il vero vincitore è l’astensionismo. Per Parigi, infatti, si è arrivati al 54%. Ed è proprio da questo dato che bisogna partire per un’analisi del voto francese. Voto che ha portato l’attuale presidente Emmanuel Macron, con il suo partito, ad un crollo che, sebbene prevedibile, non lo era stato in queste proporzioni. Così come, in queste proporzioni, non era stata prevista la cavalcata di Marine Le Pen che, invece, ha più che decuplicato la sua presenza in Parlamento. Infatti l’esponente della destra ha portato da 8 a 89 i suoi rappresentanti.</p> <p>Ma di tutti questo i mercati, oggi, non sembrano interessarsi. Ad esempio, l’Europa non si fa influenzare dalle paure che hanno portato alcuni mercati, tra cui Tokyo, a chiudere con il segno meno. Infatti l’apertura della settimana nel Vecchio Continente parte all’insegna di un possibile tentativo di rimbalzo. Invece l’Asia ha registrato una seduta in rosso proprio a causa delle possibili paure per l’arrivo di una recessione.</p> <p>Eventualità che è stata prospettata da più parti. Diverso, invece, l’approccio in altre zone. <a href="https://www.proiezionidiborsa.it/oggi-wall-street-invia-segnali-positivi-dopo-lo-schiaffo-delle-scorse-sedute-ma-le-streghe-sono-in-agguato/">Con Wall Street chiusa per festività a causa del Juneteenth National Independence Day,</a> gli occhi degli operatori sono puntati sugli interventi del numero uno della BCE Christine Lagarde, e del capo economista, Philip Lane. La speranza è che possano fornire dettagli più precisi sul sistema di aiuti per i Paesi periferici.</p> <h2>L’Europa non si fa influenzare dalle paure delle Borse asiatiche e procede cauta ma positiva</h2> <p>Attualmente il pericolo maggiore, con il rialzo dei tassi a volte potenzialmente troppo repentino per alcune Nazioni, è che si allarghi la forbice dello spread. In questo caso l’intenzione della Banca centrale europea sarebbe quella di entrare in gioco nel caso in cui ciò si verificasse. Quindi in corso d’opera e solo in caso di effettiva necessità. Ma la mancanza di dettagli ha finora gettato un’ombra di scetticismo tra gli operatori. Parallelamente l’oro attira l’attenzione degli analisti di Goldman Sachs che rivedono le stime.</p> <p>Per il metallo giallo si parla di 2.500 dollari per oncia entro la fine dell’anno. A dare una mano, tra i vari fattori, anche la crescente paura degli investitori per le difficili condizioni economiche in arrivo. Ma guardando ai mercati, almeno per oggi, sembra tornata la voglia di ridare fiducia alla Lagarde ed al suo staff. Una prova può essere quel +0,37% <a href="https://it.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=TVC%3AFTMIB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registrato</a> da Piazza Affari intorno alle 11.30. Certamente non un risultato che autorizza l’entusiasmo, ma comunque una dimostrazione del fatto che il Vecchio Continente, peraltro tutto in positivo a metà mattinata, preferisce aspettare che i vertici della BCE diano (o meno) informazioni utili.</p> <p><strong>Approfondimento</strong><br /> <a href="https://www.proiezionidiborsa.it/category/il-punto-sui-mercati/">Il punto sui mercati</a></p> ]]>

Everything else being equal, a 10% drop in the A$ could typically be expected to increase company earnings by a notional 3%. </p><p>A falling dollar is typically good for exporters, especially companies in agricultural and manufacturing sectors, as it boosts their price competitiveness in overseas markets. </p><p>Property trusts with unhedged overseas exposure should also benefit. </p><p>Impact on profitability</p><p>The A$-US$ exchange rate has a significant bearing on the profitability of Australian companies that do a considerable amount of business overseas. </p><p>If the A$ shows significant strength, then profits from their foreign operations tend to decline, which in turn can have a negative effect on the price of their stock.</p><p>Key beneficiaries of a falling A$ </p><p>ASX-listed stocks with both local and offshore earnings include stocks like <a href="https://www.marketindex.com.au/asx/csl" title="">CSL Limited (ASX: CSL),</a><a href="https://www.marketindex.com.au/asx/coh" title="">Cochlear (ASX: COH)</a>, <a href="https://www.marketindex.com.au/asx/ann" title="">Ansell (ASX: ANN)</a>, Ramsay Health Care (ASX: RHC), Amcor (ASX: AMC), and Brambles (ASX: BXB). </p><p>From an earnings perspective, a weaker A$ is also expected to have a positive (earnings) effect – especially for miners and other companies with large amount of their revenues in $US – through either conversion – when exporters compete with imports in Australia – or translation – when foreign currency is converted to Australian dollars on balance sheet. </p><p>But you need to understand that the effect of falling commodity prices and reduced demand for goods and services far outweighs the translation effect of having offshore earnings. </p><p>Included among industrial stocks positively impacted by a falling Australian dollar are Incitec Pivot (ASX: IPL),Sims Metal Management (ASX: SGM), Aristocrat Leisure (ASX: ALL),James Hardie (ASX: JHX), Treasury Wine Estates (ASX:TWE), QBE Insurance (ASX: QBE), Amcor (ASX: AMC), Boart Longyear (ASX: BLY), Domino’s Pizza (ASX: DMP), and Sonic Healthcare (ASX: SHL).</p><p>Losers when the dollar falls </p><p>Given that currency is a by-product of global economic conditions and investor risk tolerances, cyclical stocks tend to underperform their defensive counterparts in a falling A$ environment. </p><p>Similarly, the declining value of the A$ should disadvantage importers and industrial stocks with little overseas exposure, and consequently little negative translation effect. </p><p>Stocks in this category are Qantas (ASX: QAN), The Reject Shop (ASX: TRS), Wesfarmers (ASX: WES), JB Hi-Fi (ASX: JBH), Harvey Norman (ASX: HVN), Computershare (ASX: CPU), Flight Centre (ASX: FLT), plus selected media stocks, like Seven West Media Ltd (ASX: SWM).</p><p>Further currency falls</p><p>However, given that they often hedge their orders up to a year ahead of their sale period – using forward exchange contracts – the impact of a falling A$ on retailers can take some time to be fully realised. </p><p>Admittedly, the A$ is a long way from its record highs (US69.7c)</p><p>But assuming CBA economists’ are right, and the AUD/USD spends most of the next twelve months in a US60‑70c range, then there’s still plenty to be gained from capitalising on further falls.</p><p>If the A$ is destined to fall between US60-70 a review of opportunities outside Australia could also be timely.</p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/5iwbn7u1g2i4/7mfurKyaGBBxJ9p2yXwoCS/3cf0ed6744854f87e70382d6de8ea33f/image.png" alt="image"/> </description>

The participation rate is the highest ever. Our terms of trade are at the highest ever, which is really boosting our national income," he said.</p><p>"Our fundamentals are strong, and firms are trying to hire people at record rates. It doesn’t feel like a precursor to a recession."</p><p>No-risk wage growth</p><p>Lowe also reminded the market the ideal level of wages growth was around 3.5%, while wages above this risked embedding higher inflation longer term.</p><p>This is turn, added Lowe would necessitate a slower economy and possibly rising unemployment to bring it back under control.</p><p>"In the 1970s wages growth responded mechanically to the higher inflation rate. I’m hopeful we can avoid that, but it's an important issue. 3.5 per cent wage growth is better than 2%, and it's better than 5%."</p><p>1.35% on 5 July</p><p>After delivering back-to-back rate hikes in May and June, the RBA is expected to lift rates by a further half a percentage point to 1.35% when it next meets July 5.</p><p>“How fast we increase interest rates, and how far we need to go, will be guided by the incoming data and the board’s assessment of the outlook for inflation and the labour market,” noted Lowe.</p><p>The RBA governor has previously flagged that 2.5 per cent could be considered a “neutral” rate.</p> </description>

The company is expected to receive 100% of profits and cashflows from the highly profitable business post completion. </p><p>On the cost front, Newhaul is expected to lower cash costs by approximately $10 a tonne, enabling Fenix to target total cash costs of around A$70 per dry metric tonne of iron ore. </p><p>The transaction will cost the company an upfront $7.5m and 30m of ordinary Fenix shares.

			<title>Lake Resources’ selloff is further evidence the lithium party is over</title>
			<link>https://www.marketindex.com.au/news/lake-resources-selloff-is-further-evidence-the-lithium-party-is-over</link>
			<description> <img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/5iwbn7u1g2i4/YjWxAD2PhHN4Tf2iyblPv/acec612c895af9727fa68f57727131de/image.png?w=550&fm=jpg&q=80&fit=fill&f=face" alt="image" /> <ul> <li>Lake Resources was down -13.69% to the close today</li> <li>The lithium developer&#039;s share price is down -46% since early April 2022</li> <li>Lake booked a -$4.71m loss before income tax expense in the six months to December 31</li> </ul> <p><a href="https://www.marketindex.com.au/asx/lke" title="">Lake Resources’ (ASX: LKE)</a> first day as an S&P/ASX 200 company turned out to be bad omen, with the lithium developer’s share price down -13.69% to the close today. Despite the company’s fairly chipper announcement, the stock appears to have been caught up in the tough love being dished out to most players in the listed lithium space and across the broader metals market.</p><p>While lithium rivals <a href="https://www.marketindex.com.au/asx/cxo" title="">Core Lithium (ASX: CXO)</a> and <a href="https://www.marketindex.com.au/asx/sya" title="">Sayona Mining (ASX: SYA)</a> were also on the receiving end of negative market sentiment, down -6.9% and -7.14% respectively, the S&P/ASX 300 Metals and Mining Industry (ASX: XMM) also slipped -5.85% today.</p><p>What goes up</p><p>While Lake still remains inside the top 200 (now ranked 192) with reduced market cap of $1.8bn, any further losses could see it back outside this coveted cohort next time the index rebalances.</p><p>On a tear over the last year, the lithium developer’s share price is up 344% on a 12 month looksee. However, recent share price performance, down -46% since early April 2022 is further evidence that the lithium party is lower.</p><p>What Lake told the market today</p><p>Ironically, if Lake’s announcement today - that Stu Crow will serve as the company's executive chairman for six month to assist in its transition to serve North American and Asian supply chains - had been released two months ago, the share price may have gone up by as much as it fell today.</p><p>As part of this transition to North America managing director Steve Promnitz plans to leave after establishing Lake’s dominant position in Argentina.</p><p>This footnote has clearly troubled some investors given the role Promnitz has played getting the operation to where it is now.</p><p>Where to from here</p><p>Lake also reminded the market of its aspirational target is to reach capacity of 100,000 tpa by 2030. This underpin Lake’s ambition to become a leading global producer of sustainable high purity lithium.</p><p>To the uninitiated, Lake is now developing four lithium brine projects in Argentina and has more than 150 people working across all four lithium brine projects.</p><p>The company has one of the largest lithium lease holdings in Argentina amounting to more than 2,200skm with most leases owned 100%. Lilac Solutions has the right to earn up to 25% of the Kachi project upon achieving certain milestones.</p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/5iwbn7u1g2i4/33UPlbWIMde12ATfOenyqe/442a82dc5bc3e469164d91cbb5fe83b3/image.png" alt="image"/><p>Lake Resources share price over 12 months.</p> <p> What brokers think </p> <p>Lake booked a -$4.71m loss before income tax expense in the six months to December 31, due to a $990,000 increase in corporate expenses and foreign exchange losses of -$980,804.</p><p>Consensus on Lake is Strong Buy.</p><p>Based on Morningstar’s fair value of $2.51 the stock appears to be undervalued.</p><p>Bell Potter liked Lake’s 50ktpa lithium carbonate Kachi Lithium Brine Project in Argentina and had a speculative buy rating.</p><p>The broker’s target price of $2.83 suggests 90% upside of the current price.</p> </description>

According to data compiled by Dealogic, $154bn worth of Australian infrastructure asset (sales) over the past five years now makes for slim pickings.</p><p>With around half that value having been lost from the ASX, Transurban is one of only three remaining ASX-listed Australian infrastructure companies, the other two being tollroad groups <a href="https://www.marketindex.com.au/asx/alx" title="">Atlas Arteria (ASX: ALX)</a> and gas pipeline operator <a href="https://www.marketindex.com.au/asx/apa" title="">APA (ASX: APA).</a></p><p>Valuation aside, what’s likely to be attracting acquirers to Transurban is the toll road operator’s relatively stable earnings stream, and inflation-adjusted contracts.</p><p>Time for bidders to make their move?</p><p>Would-be acquirers of Transurban may be encouraged to make their move following revelation that Atlas Arteria is now in play after the recent 15% stake taken by IFM Investors, which is understood to be contemplating a full $7.8bn takeover bid.</p><p>According to  The Australian, APA is also being looked at by at least one potential buyer, and US investor Global Investment Partners was named as one fund that “could buy the business”.</p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/5iwbn7u1g2i4/422CFLztyk3hSvAZPTFazM/4be3bd44d4331d9f5df9160e8d93869f/image.png" alt="image"/><p>Transurban share price over 12 months.</p> <p> What brokers think </p> <p>While Transurban’s share price has struggled over the last couple of years, a share rally late January appears to have coincided with plans to reward shareholders with a considerably higher distribution in FY22. </p><p>Mid-April Morgans also retained its Add rating after factoring in rising dividend per share (DPS) forecasts and an increasing valuation (target price $14.42). </p><p>The broker expects Transurban to continue to attract investors due to its market cap weighting, the high quality of its assets, management team, balance sheet, and growth prospects. </p><p>Early June Credit Suisse downgraded Transurban to Neutral from outperform (target $13.60), and after a strong run and encourages investors to consider taking profits.</p><p>Meantime, Ord Minnett doubts Transurban’s positive story is over yet, urges investors not to get stuck in the bond proxy narrative, and is forecasting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10% per annum over FY21–31.</p><p>The broker retains an Accumulate rating, with an increased price target of $15.85, from $15.
